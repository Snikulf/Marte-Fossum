-- Feedback for waveproject -- 

First off, it is good to see a proper report written in latex. I do not see anything done wrong in the derivations,
but you should include the calculations for the boundary conditions for verification that they have been implemented correct. 

When it comes to the code, more specifically wave_project.py, there is absolutely no need to spend over 1000 lines to describe
what could have been done in far less code. It is not very easy to read or to find mistakes. Thus, I have not read through 
the lines to try and find the error. 

Your program runs, but shows the wrong convergence rate. This is how far I got as well, thus I can't tell what is wrong with
your code.

Tip: include a .gitignore so your __pycache__ folder does not make your repository ugly.
