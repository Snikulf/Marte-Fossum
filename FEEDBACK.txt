Hi,

Report:
The report is empty, and I tried to look through the files you have uploaded to see if you've just forgot to compile them, but I couldn't find any text in any of the files.

So I think it is fair to assume that you haven't solved part a, and b of the first assignment.


Code:
c)
I think your answer to part, c is right, It is actually a clever way of finding the residual discrete equations.

d)
Part d also seems right. You have a function, although because there is no reprot, I cannot see if you have looked at the results of the quadratidc solution or not.

e) Missing

f) Missing

g) Missing.
