For the report: 
Tt is nicely written but with some mistakes. 
The variational form should be implemented after doing integration by part. 
You state that you do this for task f), however I don't understand why you didn't do it from the start.
Remember that what you write in b) only holds for a single Picard iteration.
Seems like the tasks e) and f) have not been properly accomplished, although it at least explains the observations and attempts to find solutions.

For the implementation: 
The program runs as stated in the report. 
For task e) the E/h is not constant. 
I think there are several errors causing this:
	In your report you have not used integration by parts to get the variational form.
	FEniCS demands you to do this.
	In this way you would have also accounted for the Neumann boundary condition.
	Instead you have implemented a Dirichlet boundary condition which is not correct.
	Also it is stated in the problem that dt=dx**2, but you have dt=dx.
There must be something else, but I'm not sure what, however I think those are the most important in terms of misunderstanding.
Possibly check that the Picard iteration is correctly done, you could do several just to check this.

Also, you are not changing the time variable in the source term (f.t=t) as you update the time.
 
I guess the same errors applies for task f). There is another error somewhere, but even after trying to do some investigation I can't find it unfortunately
Seems like the numerical scheme is adding some term that shouldn't be there for every timestep though, from printing the solution at each timestep.

In task g) I believe the point was to list possible errors of a correctly implemented scheme (errors due to numerical integration, dicretization, round-off errors etc) and not particularly what is giving errors in your program.

Hope it helps!
