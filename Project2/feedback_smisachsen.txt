The report is nicely written and looks good, but I found a couple of things to be missing:

1. The integration by parts should have been done to (2) in
  order to obtain the a(u, v) = L(v) formulation needed for
  fenics. As far as I've understood having second order
  derivatives in the a(u, v) causes problems in Fenics, and may
  explain the errors we see later. I saw that what I think is the
  correct a(u, v) was commented out in the .py file,

2.
