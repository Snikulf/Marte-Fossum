The report is nicely written and looks good, but I found a couple of things to be missing:

1. The integration by parts should have been done to (2) in
  order to obtain the a(u, v) = L(v) formulation needed for
  fenics. As far as I've understood having second order
  derivatives in the a(u, v) causes problems in Fenics, and may
  explain the errors we see later. I saw that what I think is the
  correct a(u, v) was commented out in the .py file, so maybe you tried that
  a as well? The Picard iteration is done using the right substitution (u = u^-)
  but will be wrong due to the lack of integration by parts.

2. In d) I think you should've choosen an exact constant solution that is not
  u(x, t) = 1. If you want to test an implementation several mistakes may lead
  to the result being 1, instead I would choose some random number that is really
  unlikely to occur by chance.

3. In e) we are supposed to use dt = dx^2, as far as I can see this is not done,
  as we will have dx = dt.

4. You could have mentioned the error from the picard method in the list of errors
 but this isn't anything major.


All in all the implementation has a few issued that yield the incorrect results,
but I think it's possible to get this to work with a few hours of debugging. The
report was nicely written, and contains brief discussions around what can cause
the errors we see when running the program.

Have a nice day!
